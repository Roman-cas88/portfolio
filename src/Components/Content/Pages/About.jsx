        <h1>About me</h1>
     <p>
      My name is Roman Orekhovskyi. I came to Sweden from Ukraine in July.

I have a higher academic education for a specialist degree in project and program management. Studying at this faculty allowed me to acquire versatile theoretical knowledge, as well as get acquainted with HTML and CSS.

Unfortunately, due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, my family and I were forced to leave our home and work in Ukraine. Since I am particularly interested in IT development, I would like to take this opportunity to change careers and enter the world of technology as a front-end developer.

Every day I spend a lot of time on self-education to get up-to-date knowledge and professional skills such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js.

Since I'm new to Sweden and open to new challenges, I'm currently looking for a job or internship as a junior front-end developer.

I am a sociable, responsible and very easy to train person. I work well both on my own and in a team.
In my free time, I love learning new things and spending time with my family.

I am sure that I will be useful to the company, last two years in Ukraine I have worked in non-standard conditions for me, completing projects that are not familiar to me from the technical side, but I did not give up and always found solutions to problems by communicating with customers, specialists in this field and reading the documentation.
